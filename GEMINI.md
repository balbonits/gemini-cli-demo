# Gemini CLI Demo Project

This file contains the context and conventions for the Gemini CLI Demo project.

## Project Overview

This project is a showcase of web component-based applications built by Gemini. The showcase is a single-page application that displays a collection of web component apps in a card-based layout. When a card is clicked, the corresponding app is launched in a modal window.

## Coding Standards and Conventions

*   **Programming Style**: Functional programming principles are preferred.
*   **CSS**: BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention is used for CSS classes.
*   **Development Methodology**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is the desired approach.
*   **Architecture**: The project follows a modular architecture, with each app built as a self-contained web component.
*   **Design Pattern**: Web Components are the primary design pattern used for building the applications.
*   **Changelog**: The `DEV_JOURNEY.md` file in the root directory tracks the development activities of the showcase project. Each app also has its own `DEV_JOURNEY.md` file.

The following apps are included in the showcase:

*   **To-Do List App**: A simple to-do list application.
*   **Calculator App**: A simple calculator.
*   **Weather App**: A weather app that uses the Open-Meteo API.
