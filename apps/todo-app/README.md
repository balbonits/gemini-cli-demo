# To-Do List Web Application

A simple and elegant To-Do List application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using Web Components for a modular and framework-free architecture.

*   **Mark tasks as complete**: Mark tasks as complete with a single click.
*   **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks from your list.
*   **Persistent Storage**: Your to-do list is saved to your browser's local storage, so your tasks will be there when you come back.
*   **Component-Based Architecture**: Built with Web Components for a modular and maintainable codebase.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3**
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
*   **Web Components**:
    *   Custom Elements
    *   Shadow DOM

## How to Run

To run this application locally, you can use a simple local server. Here are a few options:

1.  **VS Code Live Server**: If you are using VS Code, the "Live Server" extension is a great option. Simply right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".

2.  **Python's HTTP Server**: If you have Python installed, you can run the following command in the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

3.  **Node.js `serve` package**: If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `serve` package:
    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```

Once the server is running, you can access the application in your web browser at the provided local address (usually `http://localhost:8080` or `http://localhost:3000`).

## About This Project

This project was created by Gemini, a large language model from Google, to demonstrate its capabilities in building a complete web application from scratch. The entire project, including the code, documentation, and this `README.md` file, was generated by Gemini based on a series of natural language prompts.
