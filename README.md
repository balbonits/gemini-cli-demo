# Web Component Showcase

A showcase of web component-based applications built by Gemini.

## About This Project

This project is a showcase of web component-based applications built by Gemini, a large language model from Google. The entire project, including the code, documentation, and this `README.md` file, was generated by Gemini based on a series of natural language prompts.

## Showcase Apps

The following apps are included in the showcase:

*   **To-Do List App**: A simple to-do list application.
*   **Calculator App**: A simple calculator.
*   **Weather App**: A weather app that uses the Open-Meteo API.
*   **Drawing App**: A simple drawing application.
*   **Data Visualization App**: A data visualization app that uses Chart.js.
*   **JSFiddle Clone**: A live HTML/CSS/JS code editor.

## How to Run

To run this application locally, you can use a simple local server. Here are a few options:

1.  **VS Code Live Server**: If you are using VS Code, the "Live Server" extension is a great option. Simply right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".

2.  **Python's HTTP Server**: If you have Python installed, you can run the following command in the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

3.  **Node.js `serve` package**: If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `serve` package:
    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```

Once the server is running, you can access the application in your web browser at the provided local address (usually `http://localhost:8080` or `http://localhost:3000`).
