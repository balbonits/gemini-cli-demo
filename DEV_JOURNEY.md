*   Decided to build a To-Do List application using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
*   The application will be built using Web Components to create a modular and componentized architecture without frameworks or libraries.
*   Created the initial file structure for the To-Do List App: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `src/app.js`.
*   Defined the main `<todo-app>` web component as a placeholder.
*   Created the `src/components` directory to store web components.
*   Created the `<todo-input>` web component to handle adding new tasks.
*   The `<todo-input>` component emits an 'add-todo' custom event on form submission.
*   Updated the main `<todo-app>` component to include the `<todo-input>` component.
*   Created the `<todo-list>` web component to display the list of tasks.
*   Updated the main `<todo-app>` component to include the `<todo-list>` component.
*   Implemented the logic to add new tasks to the list when the 'add-todo' event is received.
*   Created the `<todo-item>` web component to represent a single to-do item.
*   The `<todo-item>` component includes a checkbox for completion and a delete button.
*   It emits `toggle-complete` and `delete-todo` custom events.
*   Updated the `<todo-list>` component to use the `<todo-item>` component.
*   Enhanced the `<todo-app>` component to handle `toggle-complete` and `delete-todo` events.
*   Created a `StorageService` to handle local storage persistence.
*   Updated the `<todo-app>` component to use the `StorageService` to load and save the to-do list.
*   Added final styling and polish to the application.
*   The To-Do List application is now feature-complete.
